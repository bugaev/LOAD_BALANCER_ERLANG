# LOAD_BALANCER_ERLANG

This is a load balancer implemented in Erlang for unmanaged clusters.

It consists of two parts: server and client.
To submit a job, use "send2queue.erl" from Bash.

To start a server, load bvvq.erl inside Erlang environment and start "s()".

Make sure that you have described your nodes in a resource file.
